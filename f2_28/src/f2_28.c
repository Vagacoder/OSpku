 Description : textbook P. 131 Figure 2-28
 	 	 	 	 The producer-consumer problem using semaphore

 	 	 	 	 Note:
 	 	 	 	 (1). In this example, semaphore is not same as described in
 	 	 	 	 textbook;
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 This example		  Textbook
				 Init val		   1					1

				 P before test     s--					None
				 P test			  s<0					s>0		s==0
				 P test op		  sleep					s--		s-- and sleep

				 V before test	   s++					s++
				 V test 		  s<=0					s<=0
				 V test op		  wakeup				wakeup

				 (2) Can we invert P and V operations? Is there any deadlock?
				 2x P operations (before insert/remove) can NOT be inverted;
				 2x V operations (after insert/remove) can be inverted;

				 (3) Details for deadlock in (2), when 2x P ops are inverted:
				     Suppose that the two P ops in the producerâ€™s code were
				   reversed in order, so mutex was decremented before empty
				   instead of after it. If the buffer were completely full,
				   the producer would block, with mutex set to 0.
				     Consequently, the next time the consumer tried to access
				   the buffer, it would do a P op on mutex, now 0, and block
				   too. Both processes would stay blocked forever and no more
				   work would ever be done.
